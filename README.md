# projects
A repo with links to my projects.

This is kinda like an index to be able to say like: "Yo, look at my `projects` repo to find all the personal projects I am working / have worked on".

Projects here are varied, some learning, some replicating papers, some doing original stuff, etc.

Each list is probably sorted by the date when I started the project.

# Paper replication

* [Pointer Networks](https://github.com/gchaperon/pointer-networks)


# Learning

* [The C Programming Language](https://github.com/gchaperon/the-c-programming-language)
