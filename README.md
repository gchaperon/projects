# projects
A repo with links to my projects. The list here is hopefully continually growing.

This is kinda like an index to be able to say like: "Yo, look at my `projects` repo to find all the personal projects I am working / have worked on".

Projects here are varied, some are about learning langs or new techs, some are about replicating papers, some are original stuff, etc.

Each list is probably sorted by the date when I started the project.
